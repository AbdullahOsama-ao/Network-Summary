> ### `1. Peer-To-Peer` [Work Group]

 - There is No Centralized Device
 - All Devices In This Network Have The Same Permissions
 - There is no specific Device Control In Turn off/on This Network
 - Each Device has its own Security & Administration
 - Can make sharing to any resources in the network (like printers)

 - It used in Big Companies
 - There is a (Centralized Device) called server with specific Roles and Characteristics
 - This Server Can Provide Services For Client Devices
 - too, It is Responsible and can Control all Network with Client Devices in it
 - And it is responsible for sharing resources like (printers, file, and databases)
 - The Client Device Request a service from The (server)
 - There is a Scalability in easy way
 - There is (Centralized Administration), such that I can control all client devices using (Server).
 - To Burn windows copy, backup, or restore processes it is so easy in this kind of Network, because I do this only on (server) and it is applicated automatically on client devices.
 - The Person who responsible for (Server) is called (system admin OR network admin)
