It is the Layout of The Network. It shows How (Devices) Connect Physically with each other in my Network.<img src = "Images\3(1).png" alt = "missed photo" width="400" height="300" style="margin:0"/>





#### `Types Of Topologies:`

> `1. Bus Topology`

- Central Cable : Called (Bus)

- Dropped Cables : They are Cables get out from [central cable] connected to [end devices]

- T-Terminator  : Prevents Data Reflection in [central cable]. such that it make [Data] recircle in [central cable] again.

  `EX` 

  - If [device A] want to send (frame message) to [device B]
  - The message will traverse across [central cable] and reach to all [devices] in our Network
  - But only [device B] will accept the (frame message)
  - Because the (frame message) carries with it (IP Address) of the Network and (Destination MAC Address) of The Desired Device
  - So, Only [device B] That have the same (MAC address) will accept this (frame message), and another devices won't accept it.

  

  

  `Advantages` 

  - Inexpensive
  - Easy to Install or applicating comparing to other Network Topologies

  

  `Disadvantages` 

  - Low Performance:

    ​	If there are 2 devices send Data between them, it must for other devices to wait them until this process ends for avoiding [Data Collision].

  - Limited Computers:

    ​	one [central cable] is used for limited Computers, for avoiding [data collision] and happening weak signals in it

  - Low Fault Tolerance:

    ​	All Devices In this Network Topology Depend on [central cable], so, if it had a problem, The whole Network will drop. [So, we can't benefit from this Network Topology during errors, failures or problems].

  - Less Secure:

    ​	Although Only Desired Device Can accept a message from a specific Transmitter device, but this message is be sent to all devices in my Network, that Causes Less Secure and Privacy on My Sent Data



> `2. Ring Topology`

​	Data passes in only 1 direction.

<img src = "Images\3(3).png" alt="miessed photo" width="400" height="300" style="margin:0">

`Advantages` 

- Easy To install
- No Data Collision

`Disadvantages`

- Slower Transformation : ex(sending data from A to D need to pass across B & C Firstly)
- Low Fault Tolerance : ex(if a device in This ring have a problem, this will cause dropping in my Network)
- Difficult To Reconfigure : If I had a problem in a device in this Ring, To replace it with another one, This needs a lot Effort and Time , And Network Will still dropped until adding this new Device in our Network.



> `3. Mesh Topology`

​	Each 2 device in my Network Have (point-to-point) Link.

<img src="Images\3(4).png" alt="missed photo" width="400" height="300" style="margin:0">

`Advantages`

- No Fault Tolerance
- Low Traffic or Traversing Problems
- More Secure and Privacey

`Disadvantages`

- So High Cost : Needs a lot of (Cables) & (Network Interfaces)NIC
- With Increasing Network Devices, It will Be (Difficult To Install)
- And (Difficult To Manage &  Troubleshooting)

`Note: Although it Have Disadvantages In Connecting Between Devices, But It is Good In Connecting Between Routers`



> `4. Star Topology`

- It depends on exists of a [Central Device] or more Between Network Devices, like (switch or Hub).
- Each Device Connects to [Central Device] using only 1 Cable.

<img src="Images\3(5).png" alt="missed photo" width="400" height="300" style="margin:0">

`Advantages`

- Inexpensive

- Scalability : 

  No Need to disrupt the network for renew a device in our Network, if problem happen to specific [end device] in my Network.

`Disadvantages`

- Single Point Of Failure :

-  If a problem happened to My (Central Switch), My Network will Dropped, 

  But Still I can solve this problem using Concept Called [Redundancy]=>(By adding Additional Switch working always as Standby Switch Besides The Core or Central Switch if a problem happened to it).
