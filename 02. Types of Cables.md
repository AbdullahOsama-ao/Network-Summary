### `What is Network Compontents I need to make a Network`

> #### `1. End Devices`

such as Computers, laptops, Tablets, and Phones





> #### `2. Network Media`

It must be a (physical connection) between the devices in our Network, It can be:

1. wired connection (Cables)
2. wireless connection (Radio Frequency)

##### `Kinds Of Cables`

> ##### Coper Cables

- Coaxial Cable

   <img src="Images\2(1).png" alt="missed photo" width="300" height="200" style="margin:0"/>

  It become rarely used now, it is used with TV Dishes, Its Components are bellow:

1. Core (coper wire): that data transfer across it

2. Isolation: that Covers (Core)

3. Coper Mesh or (Wire Mesh): Protected and Ensure That the signal is protected from any interference

4. Outer Jacket: Made from PVC( **polyvinyl chloride**)

   

- Twisted Pair Cable

  It is mostly used these days, Its Kinds are:

1. Cat 5: its Violate in transferring Data is (100 Mega Bits per Second Mbit/s), [100*10^6 signals per second]
2. Cat 5e: its Violate is (1000 Mbit/s)
3. Cat G: its Violate is (10 Gbit/s)



- Notes

1. All of these 3 kinds have the same Shape but different in Manufactured Material.
2. (RJ45) is the ended-edges that is used to connect (transmitter and receiver devices) using these Cables.

3. The Furthest Distance Can be applicated in this kind of Cables is (100 Meter), more than of it will cause data-loss

- It used when we are in need for Cables have ability for transferring data more than (100 meter), or more quick transferring Cables
- This Cable is a (Light Ray) that Carry (1 Bit) that get out from (Transmitter) to (Receiver) after a group of Reflections, So it is used in (Quick Transferring)
- Its Components:
  1. Glass Core : Reflections Happen inside it
  2. Glass Cladding : Protects the Glass Core
  3. Plastic : Covers The Glass Cladding
  4. Kevlar Fibers
  5. Outer Jacket





> #### `3. Network Interface`

- As we know that PCs only recognize data in 0 and 1 only

- And In another side, (physical media) such as (Coaxial Cable) is made of (coper) recognize only electric signals

- So, we are in need for an (interface) that enable me to convert from (0 and 1) to (electric signals)

- So, we will use (Network Interface) to do this Task

- We will use this (network interface), once inside (network transmitter) to convert form (0 and 1) to (electric signals), to (media can recognize it)

- And, once in (Network receiver) to convert from (electric signals) to (0 and 1) (to receiver can recognize it)

- If (physical media) is (fiber cable) it converts (bits) to (light signals)

- If it is (wireless connection) it converts (data) to (radio frequency)

> #### `4. Network Protocol`

Protocol : looks like a language or it is a set of specific rules that (devices) in our network can understand each other according to them, and transfer Data among, too.

Notes : 

- it must to any 2 devices have the (protocol) to can understand and transfer data between each other.
- The most famous Protocol is called (IP)Internet Protocol.



`It could be another components in our Network More than the 4 components we mentioned above such as  Router  &  Switch, But Those 2 Components are not Essential Components, Because I can Build a Network Without I am in Need to them,`

` So, The Componetnts We mentioned Is Essentials must be found in any Network Be Built`
