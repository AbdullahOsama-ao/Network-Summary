## `we can Categrorized Network Types to 2 Categories:`

1. Geographical Area
2. Host Role





## `Consider to Geographical Area`



> ### `1. pan` [Personal Area Network]

​			It is the smallest Network Area you can connect your devices across it, between (10meter to 15meter).

​			`ex` 

​			Connecting Your personal devices like (phones, tablets, and PCs) across Wireless Connection like:

- Bluetooth,
- Infrared Light, or
- NFC (near field communication)		

​			or Wired Connection like:

- USB Cables

​		`we use it to transfer small data like (images, videos, and Audios Files)`



> ### `2. LAN` [Local Area Network]

​			It is a Network Connection that connect devices at the same place or build, like: (office, home, or cafeteria)

​			`ex`

​			[Ethernet LAN], that connect some devices using (switch device) and (ethernet cables)



> ### `3. WLAN` [Wireless Local Area Network]

​			It looks like [LAN], But the difference that the connection done using wireless communication Devices Like (Routers).

​			`ex`

​			Printer & File Sharing across WIFI Connection



> ### `4. CAN` [Campus Area Network]

​			It is a group of 2 or more of [LAN Networks] in Limited Geographical Area Connected with each other.

​			`ex`

​			Connection Between University Faculties, (each faculty has LAN Network, And all connect with each other).



> ### `5. MAN` [Metropolitan Area Network]

​			It looks like [CAN Network] but has wider Geographical Area Communication than it.

​			`ex`

​			Connection Between Branches of specific Company in a City

   - we can use [Internet Network] for Connection Between [LANs Networks] in this Network
   - it is high speed Network and use (Fiber optics Cables) For Connecting Between Networks



> ### `6. SAN` [Storage Area Network]

​			It is a High Speed Network consists of:

   - Disk Arrays (HDD or SSD),
   - Servers, And
   - Switches to connect them with each other

​		`why we use it?`

- To enhance Data Storage & Access
- And Enhance Backup & Restore Processes
- Scalability, such that I can add New (disks, servers, or switches) easily, without rebuilding or disrupting My Network.
- Not Affected By Traffic Signals (like LAN Networks), Because it is considered as (isolated Network) for reaching Data at any time.	



> ### `7. WAN` [Wide Area Network]

​			It is The most Wide Area Network in Geographic, It is connected a lot of other Network Types (LAN, CAN, MAN) All over the world.

​			`ex`

- [Internet Network], that Connects between Countries and Other Networks all over the world.
- When you are watching online video on YouTube, at this moment, you are considered at [LAN Network] and your Network is a portion of [Internet WAN Network] that connect your [LAN Network] with YouTube Servers in United States.
